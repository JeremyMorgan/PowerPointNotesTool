"Let's look at Python's impressive growth over the years. In 2010, it became the most popular introductory programming language in U.S. universities. By 2015, Python had taken the lead in data science and machine learning. In 2018, we saw its adoption surge in web development with frameworks like Django and Flask. The COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 further boosted Python's usage for rapid application development. And in 2021, Python surpassed Java as the second-most popular programming language according to the TIOBE Index. This growth shows Python's increasing importance in the tech world."
